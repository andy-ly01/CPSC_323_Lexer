# PROJECT 1: Lexer/Scanner

Group members: Andy Ly - Andy_ly01@csu.fullerton.edu

Lexer function that asks for user input (txt file) and scans
the text document char-by-char.  The function will then break down
the source text into tokens and the token value known as lexemes.
When the function reaches end of file it will return an output 
text file with the token and lexemes categorized.  This function
was written to only run the cases for the given input_scode.txt file.

How To Run:
1. Double click on the lexer.exe file located into the directory with all other packaged file
2. The program will prompt user to enter the name of the input text file(text file should be in the same directory as executable file)
3. The program will prompt user to enter the name of the output text file.
4. When the program reaches the end of file the output will be saved as a text file in the same directory as executable file.
